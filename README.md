# Polate Wellness Centre: Health & Wellness

## 1. Business Understanding
Polate Wellness Centre has observed a significant rise in patients reporting poor sleep quality, which is affecting their daily productivity and overall well-being. To proactively address this growing concern, the Centre is seeking data-driven insights into the factors associated with sleep disorders.

As part of this initiative, I have been tasked with analyzing existing sleep health data to uncover patterns, trends, and similarities among individuals who suffer from sleep disorders such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea. 

These insights will serve as the foundation for developing effective early screening tools, designing a user-friendly app for tracking sleep patterns, and ultimately integrating predictive diagnostics into routine care, once the Centre begins collecting its own patient data.

**Why is this important?**
If your lifespan is 75 years and you sleep for 8 hours a day, you will have spent 25 years asleep that's a full one-third of your life devoted to rest.
But sleep isn’t just about time it’s about quality. Poor sleep quality or sleep disorders can turn those 25 years into fragmented restless nights that affect your health, mood and productivity.
Dive with me as we explore what truly affects sleep quality and uncover the sleep disorders such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea that disrupt this essential part of our lives. Through data driven insights, we will understand the factors influencing sleep and how to improve this critical component of overall well-being.
